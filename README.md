### Concept

libpurple plug-ins are written in C.  
The signal client library is written in Java.  
This project uses JNI to create a Java VM instance within the C part of the plug-in. An instance of the Java Class implementing the signal client is created. Upon receival of a message, a static method is called. This call-back method is a native method implemented in C. It forwards the data to libpurple.  
This may be considered dark magic by some.
